# Recycled Water Irrigation Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the volume and patterns of recycled water irrigation by all customers. The goal of this project is to monitor, assess, and report on the usage and patterns of offsite recycled water users. The analysis includes data collection, statistical analysis, and volume visualization.

## Disclaimer

**Important Note**: This repository is part of an actual work project. Although the irrigation volume data will be provided to different external stakeholders and released to the public, considering it is used on my personal profile, all location names have been removed or anonymized to comply with privacy and confidentiality agreements. The data and visualizations included are for demonstration purposes only and do not disclose any sensitive or proprietary information.

## Overview

This project focuses on monitoring and analyzing the water usage and irrigation patterns by offsite users. By examining the irrigation volume based on users, supply sites (wastewater treatment plants), and regions, over different time steps (financial year, quarter, month), we aim to understand user irrigation patterns, identify potential system limitations, and assist in developing strategies for system upgrades and marketing to new recycled water users.

## Data

The dataset includes recycled water meter readings saved in our TechnologyOne system. The readings are recorded fortnightly or monthly, depending on the specific wastewater treatment plants.

## Dashboard Key Information and Benefits

### Key Information Displayed on the Dashboard:

- **Sum of Irrigation per Fiscal Year**: A bar chart summarizing the irrigation volume for each fiscal year, demonstrating the usage trend on an annual basis.
- **Sum of Irrigation by Fiscal Quarter**: A line chart showing the quarterly irrigation volume, providing detailed insights into irrigation patterns.
- **Sum/Average of Irrigation by Month**: A line chart displaying the monthly irrigation volume, indicating the start of the irrigation season, peak irrigation months, and identifying potential system supply capacity to meet demand.

### Benefits of the Dashboard:

- **Trend Identification**: Easily identify usage trends over time.
- **Key Insights**: Quickly access key information about peak and off-peak demand by observing the monthly irrigation volumes.
- **Site Comparison**: Compare irrigation volumes across different users, supply sites, and regions.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use the insights provided by the dashboard to make informed decisions regarding recycled water management.
